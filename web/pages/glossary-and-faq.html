            <div id="web-basics" class="hidden">
                <p>Here are some basic questions and answers about the web:</p>
                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-01', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">What is the difference
                    between the Internet and the World Wide Web?</h5>
                <div id="web-basics-01" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        The Internet was invented in the 1960s as a way to connect computers together so they could share
                        information. It was originally a military project started during
                        the Cold War, and so it was designed to be a decentralized network that could withstand a
                        nuclear attack. That made it very robust and reliable, but it was also
                        very complex and difficult to use. Although it allowed computers to share information at a basic
                        level, it was not user-friendly and required a lot of technical
                        knowledge to use.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The World Wide Web was created as a way to make the Internet more user-friendly. It was designed
                        to be a system of interlinked hypertext documents that could be
                        accessed via the Internet using a web browser. The World Wide Web made it much easier for people
                        to access and share information on the Internet, and it quickly became the dominant way people
                        used the Internet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The World Wide Web started as a way to share text dissertations and research papers among
                        scientists, but the launguage used to create web pages (HTML)
                        and the protocols used to access them (HTTP) quickly evolved to allow for more complex and
                        interactive content.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-02', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">Who invented the World Wide
                    Web?</h5>
               <div id="web-basics-02" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN (the
                        European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland.
                        He created the first web browser and web server, and he also developed the first version of HTML
                        (Hypertext Markup Language), which is the standard language used
                        to create web pages.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-03', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">How does the web work?</h5>
                <div id="web-basics-03" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        The web works by using a system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the
                        Internet. When you click on a link, your web browser sends a request
                        to the server that hosts the document, and the server sends the document back to your browser.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-04', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">What is a web server?</h5>
                <div id="web-basics-04" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        A web server is a computer that stores web pages and serves them to users when they request them.
                        It uses HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) to communicate with web
                        browsers. A web server can host multiple websites and can handle many requests at the same time.
                        Any computer can be a web server so long as it is
                        connected to the Internet and has the necessary software installed. Usually, though, it is a
                        powerful computer with a lot of storage space and a fast Internet
                        connection.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-05', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">What is URL?</h5>
                <div id="web-basics-05" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a web page and is the basic way to access
                        resources on the web. It specifies the location of a resource on the
                        Internet and consists of a protocol (usually HTTP or HTTPS), a domain name, and a path to the
                        specific page. It may also contain a query string or fragment
                        identifier to specify additional parameters or sections of the page.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-06', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">What is HTML?</h5>
                <div id="web-basics-06" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It is
                        used to structure content on the web.
                        The current version of HTML is HTML5, which includes features and improvements over previous
                        versions which makes it easier to create modern, interactive web pages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        HTML uses tags to define elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and
                        more. These tags are used to create the structure of the page and
                        to apply styles and formatting to the content. HTML is not a programming language, but rather a
                        markup language that describes the structure of a web page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        HTML is the backbone of web development and is used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style
                        Sheets) and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-07', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">What is CSS?</h5>
                <div id="web-basics-07" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                        document written in HTML. It is used to control the layout
                        and appearance of web pages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        CSS allows developers to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, making it
                        easier to maintain and update the design of a website.
                        It provides a way to apply styles to HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and
                        positioning. CSS can be applied to a web page in several ways, including
                        inline styles, internal style sheets, and external style sheets.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        CSS is an essential part of web development and is used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript
                        to create visually appealing and responsive web pages.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-08', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">What is JavaScript?</h5>
                <div id="web-basics-08" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within
                        web browsers. It is used to add dynamic behavior to web pages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, allowing developers to create interactive
                        elements such as forms, animations, and real-time updates.
                        It is a versatile language that is an essential part of modern web development and is used in
                        conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive web
                        applications.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-09', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">What does a web browser do?</h5>
                <div id="web-basics-09" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view web pages. It
                        interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the content of a
                        web page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When a user enters a URL into the browser's address bar or clicks on a link, the browser sends a
                        request to the web server that hosts the page. The server then
                        sends the requested page back to the browser, which renders the content and displays it to the
                        user. The browser also handles user interactions, such as clicking
                        links, filling out forms, and navigating between pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari.
                        Each browser has its own features and capabilities, but they all
                        serve the same basic purpose of allowing users to access and interact with web content.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-10', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">What is a 404 error?</h5>
                <div id="web-basics-10" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        A 404 error is an HTTP status code that indicates that the requested page could not be found on
                        the server. This usually means that the page has been moved or
                        deleted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whenever a browser sends a request to a server, the server responds with a status code to
                        indicate the result of the request. A status code of 200 means that the request was
                        successful and the page was found, while a status code of 404 means that the page could not be
                        found.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Other common HTTP status codes include 500 (Internal Server Error), which indicates that there
                        was a problem with the server, and 403 (Forbidden), which indicates that the user
                        does not have permission to access the requested page.
                    </p>

                    <p>A full list of HTTP status codes can be found on the <a

                        A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on the user's computer by the web browser while
                        browsing a website. Cookies are used to remember information about
                        the user, such as login credentials, preferences, and shopping cart contents.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When a user visits a website, the server can send a cookie to the user's browser, which stores it
                        on the user's computer. The browser then sends the cookie back to
                        the server with each subsequent request to the same website. This allows the server to recognize
                        the user and provide a personalized experience.

                    <p>
                        Cookies can be used for various purposes, such as tracking user behavior, remembering user
                        preferences, and maintaining session state. They can also be used for
                        advertising and analytics purposes.

                        Traditionally when you want to download a file from the Internet, your browser sends a request to the
                        server that hosts the file, and the server sends the entire file                to your browser.
                        This means that you have to wait until the entire file has been downloaded before you can start using it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Streaming is a method of transmitting or receiving data over the Internet in real-time, allowing
                        users to access and consume content without having to download it
                        first. This is commonly used for audio and video content, such as music, movies, and live
                        broadcasts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Streaming works by breaking the content into small chunks and sending them over the Internet in a
                        continuous flow. The user's device then receives these chunks
                        and plays them back in real-time, allowing the user to start watching or listening to the content
                        almost immediately.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Streaming can be done using various protocols, such as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and Real-Time
                        Messaging Protocol (RTMP). It requires a stable Internet connection and sufficient bandwidth to
                        ensure smooth playback without interruptions.

                    <p>
                        There are a lot of web pages on the Internet - no one knows exactly how many but some
                        estimates suggest over a billion. With that many pages, it would be impossible
                        to remember the address of every page you want to visit. So Search Engines were invented to
                        help you find the pages you want.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Search Engines work by creating an index of all the web pages on the Internet. They use
                        automated programs called crawlers or spiders to visit each page and collect
                        information about it. This information is then stored in a database, which allows the search
                        engine to quickly find and retrieve relevant pages when a user enters
                        a search query.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you enter a search query into a search engine, it uses algorithms to analyze the index
                        and return a list of relevant pages. The search engine ranks the
                        pages based on various factors, such as the relevance of the content to the search query,
                        the quality of the page, and the authority of the website.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Some search engines also use machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve their
                        algorithms and provide more accurate and relevant results.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Some search engines, like Google, collect data about users' search behavior to improve their
                        algorithms and provide personalized results.
                        This data can include information about the user's location, search history, and
                        preferences. Others focus on privacy and do not track users' search behavior,
                        such as DuckDuckGo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Popular search engines include Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. Each search engine has its own
                        unique algorithms and ranking factors, which can affect the results
                        returned for a given search query.

                    <p>
                        SEO involves optimizing various elements of a website, such as the content, structure, and
                        metadata, to make it more relevant and appealing to search engines.
                        This can include using relevant keywords, optimizing page titles and descriptions, improving
                        site speed and mobile-friendliness, and building high-quality backlinks.
                    </p>

                        A good example is to have four folders, one for HTML files, one for CSS files, one for JavaScript files, and one for images.
                        This way, you can easily find the files you need when you are working on a project.

                <div id="tips-and-tricks-03" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        Use consistent naming conventions for your files and folders to make it easier to find what
                        you need. Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores or hyphens.
                   </p>

                    <p>
                        You won't believe how much easier it is to write programs when you use consistent naming conventions.
                        It makes it easier to read and understand your code, and it helps you avoid mistakes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Using consistent names doesn't just apply to files and folders, it also applies to variables, functions, classes and other code elements.
                        For example, if you have a variable that stores a user's name, you might call it <code>user_name</code> or <code>userName</code>.
                        The important thing is to be consistent in your naming conventions so that you can easily understand your code.

                <div id="tips-and-tricks-04" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        Don't repeat yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development that states that you
                        should not write the same code multiple times. If you find you are writing the same or similar code in multiple places,
                        it is a sign that you need to refactor your code to make it more modular and reusable. You can do this by
                        creating functions or classes that encapsulate the reusable code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, suppose you have three buttons in your HTML that all need to respond in the same way:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;button id="button1"&gt;Button 1&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="button2"&gt;Button 2&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="button3"&gt;Button 3&lt;/button&gt;
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>
                        You could write the event handlers for each button like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
document.getElementById("button1").addEventListener("click", function() { alert("Button 1 clicked!"); });
document.getElementById("button2").addEventListener("click", function() { alert("Button 2 clicked!"); });
document.getElementById("button3").addEventListener("click", function() { alert("Button 3 clicked!"); });
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        But this is not very DRY, because you are repeating the same code three times. Instead, you could
                        create a function that handles the button click event and pass the button ID as a parameter:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
function handleButtonClick(buttonId) {
    alert(buttonId + " clicked!");
}
document.getElementById("button1").addEventListener("click", function() { handleButtonClick("Button 1"); });
document.getElementById("button2").addEventListener("click", function() { handleButtonClick("Button 2"); });
document.getElementById("button3").addEventListener("click", function() { handleButtonClick("Button 3"); });
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Now you have a single function that handles the button click event, and you can easily add more
                        buttons without repeating the same code. It may not look much better in this simple example,
                        but in larger programs, it can make a big difference in terms of readability and maintainability.
                    </p>

                <h5 onclick="toggleSection('tips-and-tricks-05', event);" class="magic-invisible faq-title">Comment your code.</h5>
                <div id="tips-and-tricks-05" class="hidden">
                    <p>
                        Comment your code to explain what it does and how it works. This will help you and others
                        understand your code when you come back to it later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A really useful comment you can add to your code is a "TODO" comment. This is a comment that
                        reminds you to do something later, such as fix a bug or add a feature. You can use it to keep
                        track of things you need to do in your code. In fact, many code editors and IDEs
                        like Visual Studio have built-in support for TODO comments,
                        which makes it easy to find and manage them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, you could add a TODO comment like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
// TODO: Fix the bug in this function
function myFunction() {
    // Some code which doesn't work here
}
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Then, when you come back to your code later, you can search for "TODO" to find all the places
                        where you need to make changes.
                    </p>

                        Testing is an essential part of software development. It helps you catch bugs and errors before
                        they become a problem. A good rule of thumb is If it hasn't been tested, it doesn't work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are many different types of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and
                        end-to-end testing. Each type of testing has its own purpose and can help you catch different
                        types of bugs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Real software developers spend more time testing their code than writing it. They know that testing
                        is the key to delivering high-quality software that meets the needs of users.

                        Make sure your web page is secure to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Use
                        HTTPS, validate user input, and keep your software up to date.

                    <p>
                        It is very easy to make a web page that is vulnerable to hacking.
                        Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in your code to gain access to your server, steal data, or even take control of your website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is an example of a simple web page that is vulnerable to hacking:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my web page!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a simple web page that is vulnerable to hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;form action="submit.php" method="post"&gt;
            &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" id="username" name="username"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This web page has a form that allows users to enter their username and password. However, it does not
                        validate the input or use HTTPS, which makes it vulnerable to hacking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make this web page more secure, you could add input validation to ensure that the username and
                        password meet certain criteria, such as length and complexity. You could also use HTTPS to encrypt
                        the data being sent to the server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is an example of a more secure web page:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My Secure Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            function validateForm() {
                const username = document.getElementById("username").value;
                const password = document.getElementById("password").value;
                if (username.length &lt; 3 || password.length &lt; 6) {
                    alert("Username must be at least 3 characters and password must be at least 6 characters long.");
                    return false;
                }
                return true;
            }
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my secure web page!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a secure web page that validates user input and uses HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;form action="submit.php" method="post" onsubmit="return validateForm()"&gt;
            &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" id="username" name="username" required&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password" required&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This web page uses JavaScript to validate the input before submitting the form, and it also uses
                        the "required" attribute to ensure that the user enters a value for both fields. This makes it more
                        secure and less vulnerable to hacking.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Note that this is a good start but it is not enough to make your web page completely secure. You would also need to implement server-side validation,
                        use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks, and implement other security measures to protect your web page from hacking.
