            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Welcome <strong>Web Witch or Wizard</strong> to the world of web development! Here, you will learn the art of creating stunning websites and applications. For a certain value of stunning, especially if you are easily stunned. What I'm saying is this will get you started but there is a lot more to the World Wide Web than you will cover in this introduction. But I'll give you enough to start exploring on your own, if you are curious. And witches and wizards are always curious. So you are in the right place.</p>

            <h3>Prior Knowledge</h3>

            <p>This course teaches you how to write good web pages. By good, I mean well built and secure. The content is up to you. Some coding experience helps. You could have used Scratch or Python, but you do not need to know JavaScript. You should know how to browse the web and click on links.</p>

            <h3>Getting Started</h3>

            <p>You will need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A computer (desktop or laptop) capable of running a modern web browser. If you don't have a computer, you can still follow the lessons using a tablet or smartphone, but you will not be able to do any of the exercises.
                </li>
                <li>\An internet connection. As you are viewing this page online, you already have one.</li>

                <li>
                    A modern web browser (some lessons will contain instructions for using Firefox, but Chrome, Edge and Safari will all work
                    just as well).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Visual Studio Code (you can use another code editor if you prefer, such as Sublime Text or Atom but the lessons will assume you are using Visual Studio Code and you may need to improvise a bit if you use another editor).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Git. This is a version control system that will help you manage your code and collaborate with others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    PHP. This is a server-side scripting language used for web development and will be used in later lessons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sqlite. This is a lightweight database engine that will be used in later lessons.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The first lesson will help you install these tools if you need them.</p>

            <p>If you are not sure about something, check the <a href="glossary-and-faq.html">Glossary and FAQ page</a>. If you are at a Code Dojo or coding club, ask a mentor for help.</p>

            <p>On the Student Dashboard you can pick an avatar to represent you. Before you start, look at the avatars in the Gallery below and check out the Accessories you will use in the lessons.</p>

            <p>When you are ready, say the magic words and fly to the Student Dashboard to start your Web Witchcraft and Wizardry journey!</p>

            <p>Oh, yes. The magic words you need are: <!-- This is a catchphrase from Children's television show "Sooty and Sweep" --> <a href="students.html"><strong>Izzy, wizzy, let's get busy!</strong></a></p>

            <h2>Accessories</h2>

            <p>All witches and wizards need their magical accessories to help them perform their craft effectively. In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, witches and wizards can stock up on essentials from Boffo's Novelty and Joke Shop in Ankh-Morpork. Beware, though. The magic items may look stunning, but they often have unexpected side effects, if they work at all.</p>

            <p><strong>But</strong>, if you absolutely must accessorise your witch or wizard, then here is a selection of hand picked items for the discerning magical shopper to consider:</p>

                <p class="facts-item" id="item-1-3">
                    In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, witches are wise and powerful, but also practical and down-to-earth. Wizards, on the other hand, are often arrogant and self-important, believing themselves to be superior to witches. They are more focused on theoretical magic and academic pursuits, rather than practical applications.
                </p>

                <p class="facts-item" id="item-1-4">
                    Witches always wear black while wizards have pointy hats. Witches fly on broomsticks but wizards think that is beneath them and prefer to fly on magic carpets. There is a popular drinking song, sung in Discworld taverns called "A Wizard's Staff Has a Knob On The End". No one dares to sing songs about witches.
                </p>

                <p class="facts-item" id="item-1-5">
                    Generally in the Discworld series, witches are women and wizards are men. But Equal Rites, one of the first Discworld novels, tells the story of a young woman named Eskarina Smith who wants to become a wizard. And the last book, The Shepherd's Crown, published posthumously, features a young man named Geoffrey who wants to become a witch.
                </p>

                <p class="facts-item" id="item-1-6">
                    In the Wizard of Oz, Glinda the Good is a kind and benevolent witch, while Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West is, well, wicked. However, in the musical Wicked, Elphaba is portrayed as a misunderstood and complex character who is fighting against the oppressive system of Oz. She sings the show stopping song, "Defying Gravity" at the end of the first act, which has become an anthem for empowerment and self-acceptance.
                </p>

                <p class="facts-item" id="item-1-7">
                    In King Arthur legends, Morgan le Fay is a powerful and mysterious witch who is both an ally and an enemy of Arthur. The sword in the stone, which Arthur pulls out to prove his right to the throne, is not the same sword as Excalibur, which is given to him by The Lady of the Lake later in the story. Merlin is based on a combination of historical and mythical figures, including the Welsh prophet Myrddin Wyllt and the Romano-British war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus.
                </p>

                <p class="facts-item" id="item-1-8">
                    Baba Yaga is a fascinating character from East European folklore. She is often portrayed as a fearsome witch who lives in a hut that walks on chicken legs. However, she is also known for her wisdom and knowledge of magic. In some stories, she helps heroes on their quests, while in others, she is a formidable foe.
                </p>

                <p class="facts-item" id="item-1-12">
                    During the European witch trials of the 15th-18th  centuries, an estimated 40,000-60,000 people were  executed for witchcraft, with women comprising approximately 75-80% of the accused. These persecutions reflected social anxieties about power, gender, and religious orthodoxy rather than actual magical practices.

                    In England, witches were not burned at the stake but hanged. The last person executed for witchcraft in England was Alice Molland, who was hanged in Exeter in 1685. However, the last confirmed execution for witchcraft in England is sometimes attributed to Mary Hicks and her daughter Elizabeth, who were hanged in 1716. After that, the Witchcraft Act of 1735 made it illegal to accuse someone of witchcraft, effectively ending executions for witchcraft in England.

                    Sir Isaac Newton, the famous physicist and mathematician and discoverer of gravity (except everyone who ever dropped anything probably also discovered gravity, but  he was the one who wrote it down and published it), was also interested in alchemy and the occult. He wrote extensively on these subjects, although much of his work was not published during his lifetime. He believed that alchemy could lead to the discovery of the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical substance that could turn base metals into gold and grant immortality.

                    Arthur Millers's play The Crucible, which is set during the Salem witch trials in America in the 17th century, explores the theme of mass hysteria and the consequences of false accusations. It is a powerful commentary on the dangers of fear and ignorance, and how they can lead to tragic outcomes. It was written as an allegory for the McCarthy era in the 1950s, when people were accused of being communists without any evidence, leading to a climate of fear and suspicion.
