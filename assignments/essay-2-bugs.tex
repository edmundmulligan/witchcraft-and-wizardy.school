\textbf{Issue Id} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Symptoms} & \textbf{Work around} \\
\toprule
1 & Responsive code does not work well at extreme viewport sizes. & 
    Text overflows boxes or content does not fill screen properly. & 
    Warning displayed when viewport is too small. \\
\midrule
2 & Font sizes are not optimal. & 
    Text is too small or too large on some devices. & 
    Further refinement of \texttt{clamp()} values is needed. \\
\midrule
3 & Bullets in famous witches and wizards on small screens don't work well. &
    Text margins too big so text wraps awkwardly. &
    Change from bullet list to definition list as that will format better on small screens. \\
\midrule
4 & student.css is a mess. &
    Doesn't conform to the standards in other css files. &
    More refactoring needed. \\
\midrule
5 & \texttt{popovertarget} does not work on submit buttons. &
    The popover does not appear when clicking the Save Information button. &
    Use JavaScript to show a popover or alert on form submission. \\
\midrule 
6 & Website does not respect system light/dark mode preference. &
    Website always uses light mode even if system is in dark mode. &
    Use CSS media query \texttt{prefers-color-scheme} to adapt to system preference. \\
\midrule 
7 & The artwork provided by Rachel Mulligan is in JPEG format with a white background. & 
    The picture gallery looks ugly with white boxes around images. & 
    Images need to be edited to have transparent backgrounds (PNG or SVG format). \\

8 & Incomplete functionality. &
    Some features are not implemented yet. &
    Further development required to complete all features. \\ 
\midrule
9 & ARIA compliance is minimal. &
    Some elements lack full ARIA attributes. &
    Invesigate ARIA, conduct accessibility audit and improvement code if needed. \\
\midrule
10 & Don't know how acessibility checkers work. &
    How do they handle checking at different viewports given the responsive design? &
    Need more invesgation of these tools. \\
